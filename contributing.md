## Build-in-Public Philosophy

We believe in **radical transparency** and **community-driven development**. This means:

| Principle               | How We Apply It                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Process**        | All decisions are discussed publicly before implementation |
| **Transparent Roadmap** | Development priorities are visible to everyone             |
| **Community Voice**     | Feedback shapes the framework's direction                  |
| **Learning Together**   | Mistakes and iterations are shared openly                  |
| **Meritocracy**         | Best ideas win, regardless of source                       |

### Step 1: Share Your Idea

Post your suggestion on **[r/agentic_sdlc](https://www.reddit.com/r/agentic_sdlc/)**

Use one of these flair tags:

- `[Principle Suggestion]` - New or modified principle
- `[Guide Request]` - Implementation guidance needed
- `[Bug Report]` - Issue with existing content
- `[Discussion]` - Open conversation about the framework

### Step 2: Community Discussion

- Community members discuss and refine the idea
- Maintainers may ask clarifying questions
- Related research or precedents are gathered

### Step 3: Formal Proposal

If the idea gains traction:

- A maintainer drafts a formal proposal
- The proposal follows the framework's templates
- Draft is shared for final review

### Step 4: Community Vote

- Proposals are voted on by the community
- Voting period: 7 days minimum
- Approval threshold: 2/3 majority

### Step 5: Implementation

- Approved changes are merged
- Changelog is updated
- Contributors are credited

## Why Not GitHub Issues?

| GitHub Issues              | Subreddit                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Limited to technical users | Accessible to all practitioners  |
| Isolated from community    | Builds community engagement      |
| Hard to discover           | Searchable, rankable discussions |
| Less social interaction    | Threaded conversations           |
| No voting system           | Built-in upvote/downvote         |

We use GitHub for **code** and the subreddit for **ideas and feedback**.

## What is LocalM™ AiD?

LocalM™ AiD (Local Model - AI-Integrated Development) is an **Enterprise Architecture Framework** that provides governance principles for organizations adopting AI-assisted software development tools.

### The Name

- **LocalM™** - Emphasizes that AI should operate within defined local boundaries and permissions
- **AiD** - AI-integrated Development; also suggests the framework can "aid" proper adoption

---

## Framework Scope

LocalM™ AiD is **narrowly focused** on AI tool operations, NOT general software engineering:

| ✅ IN SCOPE                    | ❌ OUT OF SCOPE             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| AI tool configuration          | Software design patterns    |
| Agent permissions & sandboxing | Architecture styles         |
| Git access controls for AI     | General testing methodology |
| Data classification for AI     | DevOps practices (general)  |
| Audit trails & compliance      | Coding standards            |
| Maturity progression           | Technology stack decisions  |

---

## Core Tenets

Five foundational beliefs underpin every principle:

| Tenet                      | Statement                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Agency**           | The programmer directs; AI assists           |
| **Structured Interaction** | Methodology over "vibe coding"               |
| **Continuous Validation**  | Quality gates throughout the lifecycle       |
| **Traceability**           | All AI interactions documented and auditable |
| **Progressive Maturity**   | Grow capability responsibly                  |

---

## Why This Framework?

### The Problem

Organizations are rapidly adopting AI coding assistants without:

- Clear governance frameworks
- Defined permission boundaries
- Quality assurance processes
- Risk management approaches

### The Solution

LocalM™ AiD provides:

- **27 actionable principles** across 7 categories
- **Maturity model** for progressive adoption
- **Compliance checklists** for governance
- **Implementation guides** for practitioners

---

## Framework Structure

### TOGAF Alignment

Every principle follows a modified TOGAF structure:

1. **Statement** - Clear, actionable principle
2. **Rationale** - Why this matters (technical, business, risk, strategic)
3. **Implications** - What changes when applied
4. **Maturity Alignment** - Requirements at L1/L2/L3
5. **Governance** - Compliance measures and exceptions
6. **Related Principles** - Cross-references

### Seven Categories

| Code | Category                          | Principles |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| PS   | Planning & Strategy               | 4          |
| TSI  | Tool Selection & Integration      | 3          |
| TTA  | Team Training & Adoption          | 3          |
| DC   | Development & Coding              | 6          |
| TQC  | Testing & Quality Control         | 3          |
| DM   | Deployment & Maintenance          | 2          |
| GSC  | Governance, Security & Compliance | 10         |

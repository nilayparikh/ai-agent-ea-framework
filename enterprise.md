# Enterprise Licensing

## Beyond Open Source

The LocalM-AiD™ Framework is available under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)**, which allows free use, modification, and distribution with proper attribution.

However, we understand that some organizations have specific requirements that may not align with open-source licensing terms.

## Open Source Commitment

We remain committed to the open-source community. The MPL 2.0 license ensures that:

- ✅ The framework remains freely available
- ✅ Contributions benefit everyone
- ✅ Transparency in AI development practices
- ✅ Community-driven improvements

Enterprise licensing is an **additional option**, not a replacement for open source.
